Welcome to the Multimodal AI Code Copilot Project! This repository is designed to facilitate the development of code muigration betwen lenguages and platforms using Azure AI services and OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo Vision model.

## ðŸ“š Project Overview

This project includes:

- **Multimodal AI Integration**: Utilize the power of OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo Plus Vision model to understand and translate complex diagrams, workflows, and UML designs. This approach combines text and visual inputs to handle a wide range of tasks and scenarios, making our AI solutions more versatile and effective.
- **Azure AI Services**: Leverage Azure AI services to build advanced AI applications. These services provide the infrastructure and tools needed to develop, deploy, and manage AI solutions at scale.
- **Chatbot Development**: Develop a chatbot using Azure AI services and OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo Plus Vision model. The chatbot can understand and respond to user queries in a natural, conversational manner, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the AI system.


## ðŸš€ Run the app

This project includes a Streamlit application that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with our AI system.
